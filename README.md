# DoublePendulum
#### In order to solve this problem, we have to use lagrangian mechanics. Here, the coordinates seen in figure 1 is used.

##### Figure 1
##### The two degrees of freedom here are theta1 and theta2. 
##### If you started solving this problem, you will get the following components:
##### x‚ÇÅ= l‚ÇÅsinùúÉ‚ÇÅ


##### Figure 2
##### PE and KE:



##### Figure 3
##### From the principle of the least action (the Lagrangian by other words): L= T-V; where T is the kinetic energy and V is the potential energy.
